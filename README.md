# webappExam

Task 3:
A web-based interactive game for SÃ¡mi language learning (you could also choose other topics, the choice does not affect grading)
one example is story-based game with two modes:
story creation mode: where users can create/read/update/delete story acts (mainly text, optionally with images or more), with different options to choose that will expand to different branches of stories (multiple branches are not mandatory but encouraged. The simplest story has only one branch), for example correct answers lead to progress or different endings, while wrong answers lead to bad endings.
story playing mode: where users play the game
you are free to explore other types of games. Good design (including the branches) will be considered beneficial for grading.


REMEMBER TO DO:
Which version of Node.js is built with, and how to start the app, should be stated in the comment/readme. If this is not given, it may cause that the grader cannot run the project and affect the grades
