<h1>Admin Dashboard</h1>
<h2>Hello, admin!</h2>
<p>As an admin, you have access to create your own little game for teaching.</p>
<p>We have a dictionary with Sami words that you can choose from, or you can add your own words if they are missing.</p>
<p>Since we are a small startup, our dictionary does not yet contain all the words. You, as an admin, can help improve the game by adding new words that are not already in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Use the buttons below to manage the words:</p>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <a class="btn btn-primary" href="@Url.Action("Create", "Admin")">Create</a>
    <a class="btn btn-warning" href="@Url.Action("Edit", "Admin")">Update</a>
    <a class="btn btn-danger" href="@Url.Action("Delete", "Admin")">Delete</a>
</div>
